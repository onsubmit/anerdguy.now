<h1>Bio</h1>

<p>
  My name is Andy Young and I've been hooked on computers since I first used an
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIe" target="_blank">Apple IIe</a> in my 1st grade
  computer lab. The technology and I have grown a lot since then but my position behind the keyboard
  has not.
</p>

<h2>Professional</h2>
<p>
  I've been at Tableau since January 2021 (post Salesforce acquisition) and work from my home office
  in Redmond, Washington. I'm comfortable pretty much anywhere in the stack but my expertise is the
  Web stack with focus in the client and BFF (backend-for-frontend) layers.
</p>

<p>
  Before Tableau, I spent over 13 years at Microsoft building and testing Microsoft Entra aka
  Microsoft Account aka Windows Live aka Passport. I was on the same team during my time there
  creating the login and account managemenent UX for consumer and enterprise Entra accounts. I was
  an SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) from 2007â€”2014 until Microsoft eliminated the
  Testing role and was an SDE until I decided to move on in 2021.
</p>

<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>
  My wife and I have been married since 2011 and we have a 10-year-old son. She is a CPA (Certified
  Public Accountant) in Bellevue, WA and when I showed her this website she rolled her eyes and
  called me a nerd because that's the kind of relationship we have. I said "thank you". ðŸ¤“

<p>
  I studied Math in college and also spent about half my time in the music building. I was a member
  of many ensembles, including the WSU marching band, Jazz big band, and Symphonic band. I continued
  playing the trombone after college and was a member of the
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SoundersFCBand/" target="_blank"
    >Seattle Sounders Band: Sound Wave</a
  >
  from 2008â€”2015.

<p>
  My other interests include astrophotography, generative mathematical art, Mariners baseball, The
  Simpsons, PC and retro console gaming, and building PCs.
