<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>
  I'm currently a principal software engineer building
  <a href="https://www.tableau.com/" target="_blank">Tableau</a>'s embedded analytics platform and
  was previously at Microsoft building
  <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/what-is-entra" target="_blank"
    >Microsoft Entra</a
  >.

<p>
  I've been making web pages for longer than any reasonable person should. The first HTML editor I
  used was the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS_Editor" target="_blank">MS-DOS Editor: EDIT.COM</a>,
  which heavily inspired the design of this page.
