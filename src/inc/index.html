<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>
  I'm currently a principal software engineer building Tableau's embedded analytics platform and was
  previously at Microsoft building Microsoft Entra. I've been making web pages for longer than any
  reasonable person should. The first HTML editor I used was the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS_Editor">MS-DOS Editor: edit.com</a>, which you've
  surely noticed this page takes its design inspiration from.
